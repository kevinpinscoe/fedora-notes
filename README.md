### `fedora-42-to-43-upgrade/`

Notes and a step-by-step checklist for the in-place upgrade from Fedora 42 to Fedora 43.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FEDORA-UPGRADE-43.md` | Full upgrade checklist: pre-upgrade prep, backups, the upgrade itself, post-upgrade verification (OS, Docker, containers, SELinux, Snap, AMD GPU), and a QA sign-off matrix |
| `notes-fedora43-upgrade-planning.md` | Research notes and key findings from planning the upgrade: breaking changes in F43 (DNF 5, RPM 6, glibc 2.42), Docker/container concerns, and known upgrade failure patterns |
| `notes-system-profile.md` | Hardware inventory, disk layout, and key services on the host |
| `notes-container-inventory.md` | Inventory of all 17 Docker Compose services in `/opt/containers`, including images, ports, backup timers, and RUNBOOK status |

## Key issues documented

- **Docker CE + kernel 6.17** — Kernel 6.17 (shipped with Fedora 43) removes legacy `ip_tables` modules that Docker v28.x requires. Upgrade Docker CE to v29.x *before* upgrading Fedora.
- **AMD amdgpu page faults (kernels 6.17.9–6.18.3)** — Regression affecting some AMD GPU hardware; resolved by 6.18.4+ and 6.19.x. Mitigation: retain multiple kernel entries in GRUB.
- **KDE Plasma duplicate packages** — Plasma 6.5.1 introduced duplicate package conflicts during upgrade; resolved via `dnf distro-sync --skip-broken` or `dnf downgrade krunner`.
- **Wine upgrade conflict** — Remove Wine before running `dnf system-upgrade download`.
- **Woodpecker CI agent restart loop** — Fixed 2026-04-26: pinned to `v3.7.0`, set `WOODPECKER_BACKEND=docker`, added `security_opt: label:disable` for Docker socket SELinux access.

## Environment notes

- SELinux is enforcing (targeted policy).
- 17 Docker Compose services are managed via systemd and backed up with per-container `backup.service`/`backup.timer` units.
- Kasm Workspaces 1.18.1 lives at `/opt/kasm` and is managed separately from the Docker Compose stack.
- System backup uses `rsync` mirrors for `/`, `/boot`, and `/home`; Docker `overlay2` and volumes are excluded and must be snapshotted separately.
